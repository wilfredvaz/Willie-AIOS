# Willie AIOS - System/Product Requirements Document (SRD/PRD)

## 1. Overview
**Willie AIOS** is a lightweight, AI-driven operating system built in Golang for minimal hardware (8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, quad-core 64-bit CPU, e.g., ARM Cortex-A53 or Intel Core i3). It emphasizes modularity, AI integration, and plug-and-play extensibility, with a Borg-like singularity model (mother-child, producer-consumer) for efficient process management. The OS supports USB booting for portable deployment, excludes hypervisor and orchestration capabilities, and offers a GUI, networking, and industry-specific packages. It provides two flavors:

- **LearningOS**: For children, focusing on intuitive learning, visuals, and awards.
- **DevOS**: For developers, with tiered configurations (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert).
